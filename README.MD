# Project Refactoring Overview

## Project Purpose

This project has undergone significant refactoring to improve code quality, maintainability, and functionality. The changes can be reviewed by examining one of the refactored controllers as an example of the updated code structure.

## Refactoring Highlights

- **Authorization Overhaul**: The authorization logic was restructured, improving security and separating concerns.
- **Introduction of Service Layer**: A dedicated service layer was added, allowing business logic to be decoupled from controller actions.
- **Modularized Controller Actions**: The functionality within controller actions was broken down into services, reducing duplicated code and enhancing readability.
- **Rewritten Salesforce Queries**: The applicationâ€™s direct integration with Salesforce was improved by converting raw text-based queries into Eloquent Builder queries, making query handling more robust and readable.

These improvements collectively streamline the codebase, making it more maintainable and adaptable to future enhancements.
